# Botero

## Execution

You can run the tests to avoid running one by one with `mix test --trace` or `mix test test/exerciseX_test.exs` swapping X with 1, 2 or 3

To run the function on your own `iex lib/exerciseX.ex` and then in console run the function
#### e.g.
```sh
iex lib/exercise1.ex

iex(1)> Botero.Exercise1.is_par_or_impar(200)
"200 is par"
```
